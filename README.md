# Lavender (Modified by xB)
**This is optimized to be used with [OpenAsar](https://openasar.dev) or direct CSS injection.** 

_I personally use direct injection because it also applies the theme to the game overlay and it's waaaay faster._

# Installation
import `main.css`

`@import url("")`,

or compile it yourself after you make your changes using any sass compiler.

# Known Issues
- Scrolling sometimes glitch, you can use [SmoothScroll](https://github.com/LynithDev/SmoothScrollPowerCord) plugin to fix it.
